\[\qq{First uniqueness theorem}\]
The solution to Laplace's equation in some volume is uniquely determined by specifying potential on the boundary surface.
\[\qq{Second uniqueness theorem}\]
In a volume surrounded by conductors and containing a specified charge density, the electric field is uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given.
